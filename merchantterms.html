Please email info@acceleratedbrand.com to request a current list of Partner Programs as the Partner Program list is updated on a regular basis. ACCELERATED BRAND STRATEGIES has entered into Agreements with each Partner Program for certain services, on behalf of itself and as the representative of Merchant, to promote Merchant to Partner Program’s customers. In order for Partner Program to perform services in accordance with the ACCELERATED BRAND STRATEGIES – Partner Program Terms, MasterCard Incorporated, Visa U.S.A. Inc., American Express Company and one or more payment processors engaged by ACCELERATED BRAND STRATEGIES and/or Partner Program (individually and collectively, “<b>Card Network / Processor</b>”) will need to provide ACCELERATED BRAND STRATEGIES and/or Partner Program with certain information further described below. The purpose of these Terms & Conditions is to ensure that Merchant agrees to, and authorizes (i) Card Network / Processor monitoring and communicating this information to ACCELERATED BRAND STRATEGIES and/or Partner Program, and (ii) ACCELERATED BRAND STRATEGIES and Partner Program using the information for purposes of ensuring accurate rewards eligibility and application of rewards. <br><br>

							Merchant hereby authorizes ACCELERATED BRAND STRATEGIES and Card Network / Processor to monitor and release the following information to Partner Program: Merchant’s Card Network identification number(s) and Merchant’s payment card transaction information, including, but not limited to, cards registered by ACCELERATED BRAND STRATEGIES and/or Partner Program customers (including, without limitation, date, purchase amount, encrypted or tokenized card numbers, and payment card type) (each of the foregoing items individually and collectively, “<b>Merchant Information</b>”). <br><br>

							Merchant hereby authorizes ACCELERATED BRAND STRATEGIES and Partner Program and each of the third parties with whom ACCELERATED BRAND STRATEGIES or Partner Program may contract in connection with the Program (each, a “<b>Vendor,</b>” which excludes Card Network / Processors), to (i) use or process Merchant Information in order to determine rewards eligibility in the Program (with eligible purchases defined as “<b>Qualified Purchases</b>”), and (ii) communicate Qualified Purchases(date and time, purchase amount, last 4 digits of card, city / state / zip code, and payment card type) to ACCELERATED BRAND STRATEGIES for purposes of ACCELERATED BRAND STRATEGIES reporting to and billing Merchant. Each Vendor has confidentiality obligations that prohibit such Vendor from disclosing Merchant Information to third parties. <br><br>

							To the extent Merchant has an agreement with a Card Network / Processor, these Terms & Conditions shall not modify or terminate any such Merchant – Card Network / Processor agreement. <br><br>

							<b>Merchant Program Participation Election</b> <br><br>

							Merchant’s Authorization shall remain in full force and effect until Merchant notifies ACCELERATED BRAND STRATEGIES that Merchant elects in writing to stop the transmission of Merchant’s data to ACCELERATED BRAND STRATEGIES and Partner Program in connection with the Program.
